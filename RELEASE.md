## How It Works

The UZAYTEK HRMA desktop application:

1. **Launches a local web server** on your computer (usually port 5000-5010)
2. **Opens your default browser** to the application URL
3. **Runs completely offline** - no internet connection required for analysis
4. **All data stays local** - nothing is sent to external servers
5. **Self-contained** - includes all required libraries and dependencies

- **STL File Export** - 3D printable motor components

## Troubleshooting

### Windows
- If Windows Defender blocks the file, click "More info" then "Run anyway"
- Make sure you're running Windows 10 or newer
- Try running as administrator if needed

### macOS
- If you get "App can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer":
  - Right-click the app and select "Open"
  - Or go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy and allow the app
- Make sure you're running macOS 10.15 or newer

### Linux
- If the application doesn't start, try running from terminal to see error messages
- Make sure you have X11 display server running
- Install missing system packages if prompted

### Common Issues
- **Port already in use**: The app will automatically find another available port
- **Browser doesn't open**: Copy the URL from the desktop app window and paste it manually
- **Application freezes**: Restart the desktop application
